# nlp-support-email-classifier
A machine learning project that classifies support emails into meaningful categories using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression, with a clean Flask-based interface.

# Support Email Classification — NLP
This project is a machine learning application that automatically classifies incoming support emails into meaningful categories such as **Billing**, **Technical**, and **General**.

The goal of this project was to understand how text data flows through a real-world ML pipeline — from preprocessing and feature extraction to prediction and decision display — while keeping the interface clean and usable.
